# Language-Translation-Using-Transformer
Here, due to inavailability of data of my native language. I have used English to Spanish Translation.

Due to high computational power i used Google Colab for its implementation.

Datasets for this project can be easily found on site : https://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 
In above link we can find many data for european language.

Also two more dataset for non-breaking pefix on respective language were used for data such as a.m. p.m. etc to make device understand that they are one word and "." doesnt represent end of sentence.
Dataset for that can be found on google .

And the whole model was based on paper "Attention is all you need" .
Paper link : https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf

Here in encoder and decoder no RNN were used just fully connected layers were used. So, it implements faster.
